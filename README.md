# InfectYourCanardLaque
Trying a video game.
Naive implementation. A lot remains to be done.

# To Do List

## Data Structure
* Map Structure (use Graph and Vertice)
* Duck Structure (LTexture as a common texture for ducks : Flyweight)
* Spatial Data Struture (Reduce O(n^2) for distance beetween ducks in model update)

## Useability
* Introduce new food.
* Display Map's timer.
* Display cursor.

## Graphical
Improve tiles colors.

## IA for Generative Map
Improve map creating procedure. See Map/Graph structure.

## IA for Fatty Duck
Improve fatty duck's movement. Decision-Tree or RL algorithm (POMDP) in mind.
